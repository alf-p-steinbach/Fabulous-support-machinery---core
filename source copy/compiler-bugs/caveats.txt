==> Caveats
==> llvm
LLD is now provided in a separate formula:
  brew install lld

We plan to build LLVM 20 with `LLVM_ENABLE_EH=OFF`. Please see:
  https://github.com/orgs/Homebrew/discussions/5654

To use the bundled libunwind please use the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib/unwind -lunwind"

To use the bundled libc++ please use the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib/c++ -L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib/unwind -lunwind"

NOTE: You probably want to use the libunwind and libc++ provided by macOS unless you know what you're doing.

llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have llvm first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include"
